We chose story creator because it seems interactive between users. Also, the database aspect would be a challenge. 
Alvin: I initially started with most of the backend stuffs, set up all the routes and the adjax requests.
Tom: I set up most of front-end stuffs such as the ejs templates and the CSS portion. the design of the site's layout. talk about the eventual pair programming way of work.

show 
1. logo as the home page
2. view story
3. create story
4. contribute story
5. vote
6. accept story (only writer can see the button)
  - (show that other user can't see the buttons)


challenges:
1. git workflow
  - it took us some times to get used to the git workflow
  - tried a bunch of ways to coordinate on github
  - we overcame it through mentors' guidance and sorta force us to actually use the workflow
  - we also had to go over each other's code when we have the merge conflicts
2. Our initial code in the backend weren't that modularized. It kinda confused us near the end, so we eventually refactor the whole thing and made it more modular. eventually we got together and went over the whole code and got the refactor done.


- What each of you did, individually
- Show us what you built (demo the app and show us the features)
- What challenges you had and how you overcame them
